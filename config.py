INTRO_MARKDOWN = """
Decision-making around data – how it is accessed, used, shared and regulated – is difficult.
We’ve been exploring different ways to make this process easier, more effective and trusted.

One technique for making better decisions could be something called ‘agent based modelling’.
This technique enables the user to bring together many different factors and conditions to analyse and better see how they affect each other.
This could therefore be useful in complex decision-making involving many different considerations – something we often encourage in data policymaking.

We’ve developed a demo of an ‘agent based model’ (ABM) to show the potential benefits and challenges of such a technique.
You can play with it, learn from it and feed back on whether this is a useful approach to policymaking.

We’ve chosen to focus this demo on one issue to illustrate how it can be used: to show the impact of
[data portability](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-data-portability/)
(the ability for individuals to obtain and reuse personal data for their own purposes across different services) across big technology companies.
We focused on this because regulation of big tech companies is very much under the spotlight, and the complex nature of the data shared by these companies is hard to build policy around.

**Introducing our ABM**

How innovative a company is in developing new products can be affected by things like how freely the company shares data and how concerned customers are by privacy issues.
Data portability and openness of data flows between companies could affect innovation in product development. You can use this agent-based model (ABM) to see how different conditions might affect how companies innovate and grow. The model results are not based on real-world data and should not be used for decision-making.

You can change the conditions in which companies are operating using the buttons on the left. Each set of changes you make produces a different result, showing what companies might do in different conditions.

Data portability and openness could affect the creation and improvement of products in many ways, and the model allows you to see:\n
* whether big companies attracting lots of consumers are being created
* how much big companies are sharing data with smaller rivals
* the rate at which new products are being created and withdrawn
* whether companies specialise in one product or several products
* the degree to which consumers choose products from one or many companies
* if products are being created in old or new categories
* the degree to which consumer preferences are being satisfied
